Hello, World! 

This is the repository for **GSimas Github Webpage**. Right now I'm just testing the possibilities, wondering about what can be done 
in order to improve the website UX (User Experience), performance and aesthetics. I intend to test Jekyll and different Github Themes.
Currently, you will find nothing at all on the website, because it was barely created. But feel free to copy the source code, if you do,
please cite the developers, althought there is no LICENSE at all on this repository... Well, let's go on.

You'll find more about me on my Github profile page: [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/GSimas)

*Até mais e obrigado pelos peixes* (I suppose you know how to read portuguese)
